    <h3>short biograpgy</h3>
    <p>
       
Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India. He comes from a humble background, growing up in a small town and facing many challenges. Despite the odds, his passion for learning and unwavering determination led him to pursue higher education in aerospace engineering.

        <h1>Early life and career</h1>
Kalam was born in a town in Tamil Nadu state to a fishing boat owner from a once wealthy family. The youngest of five siblings, Kalam persevered with his education despite his impoverished circumstances. He earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. In 1980 SLV-III successfully released a satellite called Rohini into near-Earth orbit, taking India’s space program to the international stage. Kalam oversaw further development of launch vehicle technologies at ISRO, including the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle.

        <h1>Missile program</h1>
        Having rejoined DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme, which produced a number of successful missiles. Among them was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III; it was first launched in 1989. Another success was the surface-to-surface tactical missile Prithvi.

    <h1>Nuclear tests</h1>
    From 1992 to 1999 Kalam was scientific adviser to India’s defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government, with the rank of cabinet minister. During this period he played a key role in the government’s weaponization of missile systems, giving India nuclear capabilities. In 1998 he was one of the chief coordinators of the Pokhran-II series of nuclear tests, in which five bombs were detonated at a test range in the town of Pokhran, Rajasthan state. His prominent role in the country’s nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern in the international community. In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he described as a road map for transforming India from a less-developed society to a developed one in 20 years. Among other measures, the plan called for increasing agricultural productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and for widening access to health care and education.

        <h1>Presidency</h1>
        In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing Pres. Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam’s stature and popular appeal were such that he was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA despite his being Muslim, and even the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress, proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the vote of the electoral college, defeating former revolutionary leader Lakshmi Sahgal. He was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007 and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman president.

        <h1>Legacy</h1>
        Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform India into a developed country, and he served as a lecturer at a number of universities. He was a visiting professor at several campuses of the Indian Institute of Management and the founding chancellor of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (Thiruvananthapuram). He had great success in connecting with children and made it a personal mission to meet, interact with, and inspire young minds.

On July 27, 2015, Kalam collapsed while delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong and was pronounced dead from cardiac arrest soon afterward.
